Sonic Rebirth - Music Folder


- To Play the game with Ogg music, you must download them in the host
 site (http://www.powersonic.com.br/rebirth). 

And extract the music folder here

- If you move the files or rename them, those won't play in the game,
 causing some bugs. Please don't touch them, unless you know what you're doing.
